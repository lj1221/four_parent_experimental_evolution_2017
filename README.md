This repository contains source data for the manuscript "Patterns of selection reveal shared molecular targets over short and long evolutionary timescales".

Sequence reads for the time-resolved populations have been submitted to the SRA/ENA databases under study accession no. [ERP003953](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB4645) and the NCBI BioProject under accession no. [PRJEB4645](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJEB4645).

In the folder of "phenotyping", it contains the doubling time of both population and isolates evolved in hydroxyurea and rapamycin. It also contains the doubling time of the TOR1 and TOR2 constructs in various nitrogen limited conditions and the constructs with all the possible genotype combinations of TOR1 wildtype/mutated and 2-4 copies of chrIX in the SA/SA genetic background.

In the folder of "allele_frequency", it contains the allele frequency of all the ancestral and evolved populations across multiple time points, which is used for identify QTLs.
