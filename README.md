# four_parent_experimental_evolution_2017
This repository contains source data for the manuscript "Patterns of selection reveal shared molecular targets over short and long evolutionary timescales".

Sequence reads for the time-resolved populations have been submitted to the SRA/ENA databases under study accession number [ERP003953](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB4645) and the NCBI BioProject under accession number [PRJEB4645](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJEB4645). The detailed sample accession numbers are listed in the text file "sequence_reads_download.txt".

In the folder of "phenotyping", it contains the doubling time of 
(1) populations evolved in hydroxyurea (HU) and rapamycin (RM) at each transfer during the experimental evolution;
(2) isolates from the initial and HU and RM evolved final populations;
(3) the TOR1 and TOR2 constructs in various nitrogen limited conditions;
(4) the constructs with all the possible genotype combinations of TOR1 wildtype/mutated and 2-4 copies of chrIX in the SA/SA genetic background.

In the folder of "allele_frequency", it contains the allele frequency of all the ancestral and evolved four-parent populations across multiple time points, which is used to identify QTLs.
